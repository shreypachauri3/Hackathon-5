# CITY SYNC
### Sync Your City Life
CitySync is a mobile application designed to enhance the experience of living in a Smart City. The app is designed to provide residents with a comprehensive platform for accessing information and services related to their city. As of now, it is working on

Emergency SOS Services  
Food Reduction and Waste Management

but in future we are planning to expand it into various fields to overcome challanges such as

Enhancing Health and Education Services  
Providing available Employment opportunities in the city  
Managing Complaints of the citizens

Most of these elements have been incorporated into our app UI.
